Project Setup Approach
1. Project Architecture Planning
Monorepo vs Multi-repo decision: Choose monorepo for easier shared component management

Folder organization strategy: Separate apps for customer, provider, and admin interfaces

Shared resources planning: Common components, utilities, and API layers

Environment configuration: Development, staging, and production setups

2. Development Environment Preparation
Node.js and npm installation: Ensure latest LTS versions are installed

Development tools setup: VSCode with essential extensions (ESLint, Prettier, React snippets)

Git repository initialization: Set up version control with proper .gitignore

Package manager selection: Choose between npm, yarn, or pnpm for dependency management

3. React Application Initialization Strategy
Create React App vs Vite: Choose build tool based on performance needs

TypeScript consideration: Decide whether to use TypeScript from the start

Folder structure planning: Organize components, pages, services, and utilities

Routing architecture: Plan URL structure for all three web applications

React App Structure Planning
4. Application Architecture Design
Component hierarchy planning: Design reusable component library

State management strategy: Plan Redux store structure for different app states

API layer organization: Structure service calls and data fetching logic

Authentication flow design: Plan login/logout and route protection mechanisms

5. UI/UX Framework Selection
Design system choice: Select between Material-UI, Chakra UI, or custom styling

Responsive design approach: Plan mobile-first responsive breakpoints

Theme and styling strategy: Define color schemes, typography, and spacing

Component library planning: Create consistent UI components across all apps

6. Feature Module Organization
Customer app modules: Authentication, service discovery, booking, profile management

Provider app modules: Dashboard, service management, booking handling, earnings

Admin panel modules: User management, analytics, system configuration

Shared modules: Common utilities, API clients, shared components

Development Workflow Planning
7. Project Structure Strategy
Multi-app architecture: Three separate React applications in one repository

Shared dependencies: Common packages and configurations across apps

Build optimization: Code splitting and bundle optimization strategies

Development server setup: Hot reloading and proxy configurations

8. Code Organization Principles
Feature-based organization: Group related components, hooks, and services

Separation of concerns: Business logic, UI components, and API calls separation

Reusability planning: Design components for maximum reuse across applications

Scalability considerations: Structure that supports future feature additions

9. Development Standards Setup
Code formatting rules: ESLint and Prettier configuration planning

Naming conventions: Establish consistent file and component naming

Git workflow strategy: Branch naming, commit message standards

Testing strategy: Unit testing and integration testing approach

Technical Integration Planning
10. External Service Integration Strategy
Google Maps integration: Location services and map embedding approach

Payment gateway setup: Razorpay integration planning for web

Authentication system: JWT token management and refresh strategies

Real-time features: WebSocket integration for live updates

11. Performance Optimization Planning
Lazy loading strategy: Code splitting for different app sections

Image optimization: Compression and responsive image serving

Caching strategy: Browser caching and API response caching

Bundle size optimization: Tree shaking and dependency optimization

12. Deployment Preparation Planning
Build process optimization: Production build configuration

Environment variable management: Secure configuration for different environments

Static asset handling: CDN integration for images and static files

Domain and subdomain strategy: Separate domains for different apps
